By the end of this course, you will understand how to use version control, clean code, and documentation to:

- Read and maintain your code effectively
- Comply with [FAIR data principles](https://force11.org/info/the-fair-data-principles/) and [FAIR4RS principles](https://zenodo.org/record/6623556#.Y-uTsq2ZNaQ) (see also [Barker et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x))
- Avoid technical debt in research projects
- Collaborate efficiently with version control
- Leverage AI tools for code improvement and documentation
