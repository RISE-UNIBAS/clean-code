# Getting started with GitHub

## Configure your GitHub Pro account

There is [difference in functionality](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans) between GitHub Free and GitHub Pro accounts. For example, GitHub Free accounts cannot use GitHub pages.
As a student, you can get a free GitHub Pro account:

1. Sign up at https://github.com/ with your university email and choose GitHub Free.
2. [Verify](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address) your email.
3. Fill in your [billing information](https://github.com/settings/billing/payment_information) with your full legal name as it appears on your academic affiliation documentation. (You do not have to add a payment method.)
4. Go to https://education.github.com/benefits and get a (free) upgrade to GitHub Pro by following the prompts.
