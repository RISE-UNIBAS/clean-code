# Getting started with GitHub

## Configure your GitHub Pro account

There is [difference in functionality](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans) between GitHub Free and GitHub Pro accounts. For example, GitHub Free accounts cannot use GitHub pages.
As a student, you can get a free GitHub Pro account:

1. Sign up at https://github.com/ with your university email and choose GitHub Free.
2. [Verify](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address) your email.
3. Fill in your [billing information](https://github.com/settings/billing/payment_information) with your full legal name as it appears on your academic affiliation documentation. (You do not have to add a payment method.)
4. Go to https://education.github.com/benefits and get a free upgrade to GitHub Pro by following the prompts.

## Interacting with GitHub

There are [various ways](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/connecting-to-github#comparison-of-tools-for-connecting-to-github) in which you can interact with GitHub. In this course, we limit ourselves to the following:

1. On https://github.com/ via the web-interface in your browser.
2. Using [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/about-github-desktop).
3. Using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio) with GitHub integration (there are of course many more IDEs but we don't know them all well enough to offer support).

If you're not using PyCharm or RStudio (or if you want a beginner friendly experience), you must install GitHub Desktop on your machine to be able to complete the coursework.
