# AI-Assisted Coding for Clean Code and Documentation

This module covers the use of Claude Code with PyCharm for improving code quality and documentation in research projects.

## Session Materials

- [AI-Assisted Coding Session](ai_coding.md) - Full slides and notes for the 3-hour interactive session

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

- Understand the landscape of AI coding tools and their research applications
- Use Claude Code with PyCharm to read, understand, and improve existing code
- Apply AI assistance to refactor code following clean code principles (DRY, KISS, meaningful names)
- Generate comprehensive documentation (docstrings, READMEs, comments)
- Integrate AI tools responsibly into their research workflow
- Recognize the limitations and ethical considerations of AI-assisted coding

## Session Structure (3 hours)

1. **AI in research** (20 min) - Poll, landscape overview, use cases, ethics
2. **Claude Code with PyCharm** (40 min) - Live demos, installation, effective prompting
3. **Clean code with AI** (45 min) - Hands-on exercises refactoring example scripts
4. **Documentation with AI** (45 min) - Hands-on exercises generating docstrings and READMEs
5. **Best practices & discussion** (15 min) - Integration strategies, limitations, Q&A

## Prerequisites

- **Windows with WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- **PyCharm IDE** installed
- Basic programming experience (R or Python)
- Familiarity with clean code principles (covered in earlier sessions)
- Understanding of documentation basics (covered in docs session)

## Tools Used

- **Claude Code**: AI coding agent (main focus)
- **PyCharm**: IDE for development and testing
- **WSL**: Required for running Claude Code on Windows

## Exercise Files

Participants will work with:
- `../clean_code_in_context/cc_exercise/bad_script.R` - Example script for refactoring
- Their own research code (optional)

## Additional Resources

- [Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code)
- [PyCharm with WSL](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-wsl-as-a-remote-interpreter.html)
- [WSL Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

## Notes for Instructors

- Ensure all participants have WSL installed before the session
- Test Claude Code installation in WSL + PyCharm workflow
- Prepare live demo examples in advance
- Have backup examples ready in case participant code is complex
- Allocate buffer time for WSL/Claude Code setup issues
- Emphasize critical review and testing of AI-generated code
- Discuss institutional policies on AI use
- Mention that changes from Claude Code appear immediately in PyCharm
