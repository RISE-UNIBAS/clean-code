![](images/git.png "'An expressive oil painting of a programmer failing to use Git' by Maximilian Hindermann and DALLE-2")

Get you in a position to decide if Git might be useful for your work.

# On the importance of documentation

# High-level view

- principles based on IEEE
  - identify software
  - determine audience
  - determine document set
  - determine usage mode

# Standards

- e.g., IEEE

# Example in Python (implementation side if you will)
- documenting versus commenting
- docstrings
- hints/annotations
- documentation with sphinx
- readme
- file structure
-
