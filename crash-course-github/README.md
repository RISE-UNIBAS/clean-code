# Crash course on version control and documentation with GitHub

Training materials and slides for a crash course on version control, clean code and documentation with practical examples and exercises in Python and R.

## Creator

These materials were created by the University of Basel's Research and Infrastructure Support RISE (rise@unibas.ch) in 2024. 

## File structure

The file structure mirrors the outline of the course:
- slides as Markdown in [`crash-course-github/slides.md`](https://github.com/RISE-UNIBAS/clean-code/tree/main/crash-course/git/git.md) 
- slides as HTML in [`crash-course-github/slides.html`](https://github.com/RISE-UNIBAS/clean-code/tree/main/crash-course/git/git.html)
- all images used in [`crash-course-github/images`](https://github.com/RISE-UNIBAS/clean-code/tree/main/crash-course/git/images)

Pandoc was used to create HTML slides: `pandoc -s --webtex -i -t slidy in_file.md -o out_file.html`
